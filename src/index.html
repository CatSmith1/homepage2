    <p>
      I am a brand-new software developer, keen to expand my skills in all areas of development with a particular interest in design and user experience.
      <br>
      <br>
      Before I started this course I had never written code before. I was inspired to enroll thanks to a friend who was on a previous CYF cohort and now has a job working as a developer.
      <br>
      <br>
      I am originally from Brighton in the south of England, and moved to Glasgow in 2016. I love being creative and enjoy illustration and photography.
